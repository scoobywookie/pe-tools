' Define the actors and components
actor "User" as User
participant "Java GUI\n(AutoCADView)" as Java
participant "ProcessBuilder\n(Background Thread)" as PB
participant "address_to_scr.exe\n(Python Engine)" as Py
database "Raleigh\nOpen Data API" as API
participant "Desktop Files\n(.scr / .shp)" as Files

' The Flow
User -> Java : Types Address & Clicks Run
Java -> PB : Passes Address String
PB -> Py : Executes Script with Args

note right of Py
    Algorithm:
    1. Fetch data
    2. Filter by address
    3. Generate geometry
end note

Py -> API : HTTP GET Request (JSON)
API --> Py : Returns GeoJSON Data
Py -> Files : Writes .scr and .shp files
Py --> PB : Prints "Success" to StdOut
PB --> Java : Updates Log Window
Java --> User : Shows "Done" Message
